## 🖥️ Circuit Description

Each IR sensor is placed at one of the 4 parking slots. When a vehicle is detected (IR beam is broken), the Arduino updates the slot status and reflects the change on the LCD. The display shows a summary of available vs. occupied slots in real time.

## 💻 Programming Details

- Language: **Arduino C/C++**
- IDE: **Arduino IDE**
- Logic: IR sensor outputs HIGH/LOW based on vehicle presence, and the LCD prints dynamic values accordingly.
